### 1. Install Requirements
> Follow the original repo to test if you got all environment ready.
**Python 3.9 or higher ** is needed to run the toolbox.

* Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages).
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the remaining necessary packages.

### 2. Reuse the pretrained encoder/vocoder
* Download the following models and extract to the root directory of this project. Don't use the synthesizer
https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models
> Note that we need to specify the newly trained synthesizer model, since the original model is incompatible with the Chinese sympols. It means the demo_cli is not working at this moment.
### 3. Train synthesizer with aidatatang_200zh
* Download aidatatang_200zh dataset and unzip: make sure you can access all .wav in *train* folder
* Preprocess with the audios and the mel spectrograms:
`python synthesizer_preprocess_audio.py <datasets_root>`
Allow parameter `--dataset {dataset}` to support adatatang_200zh, SLR68
* Preprocess the embeddings:
`python synthesizer_preprocess_embeds.py <datasets_root>/SV2TTS/synthesizer`

* Train the synthesizer:
`python synthesizer_train.py mandarin <datasets_root>/SV2TTS/synthesizer`

* Go to next step when you see attention line show and loss meet your need in training folder *synthesizer/saved_models/*. 
> FYI, my attention came after 18k steps and loss became lower than 0.4 after 50k steps.

### 4. Launch the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:

`python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>`  
or  
`python demo_toolbox.py`  

## TODO
- [x] Add demo video
- [X] Add support for more dataset
- [ ] Upload pretrained model
- üôè Welcome to add more
